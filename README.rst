Installing Via Package Control
------------------------------


Sorry, not gonna happen.


Installing From Source
----------------------

If you're storing the package as a directory as in this example, it `must`_ be stored in the *Packages* directory under the `data directory`_. Note, this is *not* the directory Sublime Text opens when you select *Sublime Text > Preferences > Browse Packages...*! Here's an example on macOS:

.. _must: http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/packages.html#package-locations-and-abbreviations
.. _data directory: http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/basic_concepts.html#the-data-directory

- Quit Sublime Text
- If you have a previous installation of Packages/FileMaker installed, delete it
- Type the following into a terminalk::

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
	git clone https://github.com/DonovanChan/FileMaker.sublime-package.git FileMaker
- Launch Sublime Text
